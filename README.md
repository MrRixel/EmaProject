# EmaProject
Just a bot project based on PyTelegramBotAPI by etnoir

All the help you can give is welcome! :D

This bot should fetch Danbooru-like website's pictures and send to user.
## A simple, yet powerful

Ema - *Eastern Media Assistant* was made thinking on the ease-to-use feature. Coding here is simple, as much as is fast and powerful.

### Setting up the rockets!

To start the setup, you must do the following:

1. Open [/Api/acc_setup.py](https://github.com/halkliff/EmaProject/blob/Beta-2/API/acc_setup.py)
  - Change the username and password_hash to the given to you by [Yandere](https://yande.re/post) 
  [*Note: password hash is SHA1 based, where the main hash is ```"choujin-steiner--{0}--"```({0} must be the password you use to log-in)*]
2. Open [Config.py](https://github.com/halkliff/EmaProject/blob/Beta-2/Config.py)
  - Change the value of ```TOKEN``` to the token given for you by [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
  - Change the value of ```BOT_ID``` to your own bot ID, without the "@". _NOTE: IF YOU PUT THE "@", THE BOT MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY_
  - Change the value of ```BOT_NAME``` to the name you want your bot to have - Yes, you can rename your bot easily with it
  
Now you're all set! run ```Bot.py``` and watch your Ema-based bot working!
